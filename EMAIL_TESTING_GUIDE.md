# 📧 Email Notification Testing Guide

## 🎯 User Isolation Implementation Completed

We have successfully implemented **user-specific email notifications** that respect the new user isolation system. Each user now receives notifications only about their own collected properties and favorites.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### **1. User-Specific Property Isolation**
- ✅ Properties are now tagged with `collected_by_user_id`
- ✅ Each user only sees their own collected properties
- ✅ Cross-user property access is blocked
- ✅ Dashboard stats are user-specific

### **2. Email Notification System**
- ✅ Created notification service (`webapp/backend/services/notification_service.py`)
- ✅ Updated enhanced daily scheduler for user isolation
- ✅ Bargain alerts are now user-specific (only from user's collected properties)
- ✅ Price change alerts remain user-specific (user's favorites only)
- ✅ Beautiful HTML email templates with proper styling

### **3. Enhanced Daily Scheduler Updates**
- ✅ `detect_new_bargains()` → `detect_new_bargains_per_user()`
- ✅ User-specific bargain detection
- ✅ User-specific email notifications
- ✅ Updated reporting for user isolation

## 🚀 Testing the Email System

### **Step 1: Configure Email Settings**

Set up your email credentials (use Gmail App Password for best results):

```bash
export SENDER_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
export SENDER_PASSWORD="your-16-character-app-password"
export SENDER_NAME="SomonGPT Real Estate Intelligence"
```

### **Step 2: Test Email Notifications**

Run the email test script:

```bash
cd webapp/backend
python test_email_notifications.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Test email configuration
- ✅ Show all users and their property counts
- ✅ Send test bargain alerts (user-specific)
- ✅ Send test price change alerts (user-specific)
- ✅ Send test daily market summary

### **Step 3: Test Enhanced Daily Scheduler**

Run the daily scheduler to test the full pipeline:

```bash
cd scripts
python enhanced_daily_scheduler.py --run-now
```

This will:
- 🔄 Run data collection pipeline
- 🎯 Detect user-specific bargains
- 📈 Track price changes in user favorites
- 📧 Send user-specific email notifications
- 📊 Generate comprehensive reports

## 📧 Email Types and User Isolation

### **1. Bargain Alerts** 🎯
- **Before**: All users received ALL bargains (data leakage)
- **After**: Each user receives only bargains from their collected properties
- **Template**: Beautiful HTML with property cards, investment analysis
- **Content**: User-specific properties only

### **2. Price Change Alerts** 📈
- **Before**: Already user-specific (favorites)
- **After**: Enhanced templates, better formatting
- **Template**: Separate sections for price drops vs increases
- **Content**: Only user's favorite properties

### **3. Daily Market Summary** 📊
- **Before**: Global market stats
- **After**: User-specific market summary
- **Template**: Clean stats dashboard
- **Content**: Based on user's collected properties

## 🧪 Verification Checklist

When testing, verify that:

### **User Isolation**
- [ ] User A receives bargains only from properties they collected
- [ ] User B receives different bargains from their own properties
- [ ] No cross-user data leakage in emails
- [ ] Price changes are from user's favorites only

### **Email Quality**
- [ ] HTML templates render correctly
- [ ] All property details display properly
- [ ] Investment analysis shows (rent, yield, payback)
- [ ] Links work and point to correct properties
- [ ] Unsubscribe information is present

### **Performance**
- [ ] Emails send successfully to all users
- [ ] No duplicate notifications
- [ ] Reasonable email size (not too long)
- [ ] Fast delivery

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Email Not Sending**
```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $SENDER_EMAIL
echo $SENDER_PASSWORD

# Test basic SMTP connection
python -c "
import smtplib
try:
    server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
    server.starttls()
    server.login('$SENDER_EMAIL', '$SENDER_PASSWORD')
    print('✅ SMTP connection successful')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'❌ SMTP error: {e}')
"
```

### **Template Rendering Issues**
- Check Jinja2 is installed: `pip install jinja2`
- Verify template syntax in notification service
- Test with simple text content first

### **User Isolation Issues**
- Verify database migration completed: `collected_by_user_id` column exists
- Check user property counts: `python test_user_isolation.py`
- Verify enhanced daily scheduler uses new functions

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### **For User with Properties (e.g., 123@gmai.com)**
- Should receive bargain alerts for their 10 properties
- Should receive price change alerts for their favorites
- Should see user-specific market summary

### **For New Users (e.g., newuser1@test.com)**
- Should receive NO bargain alerts (no collected properties yet)
- Should receive NO price change alerts (no favorites yet)
- Should see empty market summary

### **Email Content Verification**
- Each email should clearly indicate it's user-specific
- Property details should match user's collected data
- No properties from other users should appear
- Investment analysis should be accurate

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The email notification system is working correctly when:

1. ✅ **User Isolation**: Each user receives only their own property notifications
2. ✅ **No Data Leakage**: No cross-user property information in emails
3. ✅ **Beautiful Templates**: Professional HTML emails with proper styling
4. ✅ **Accurate Data**: All property and investment details are correct
5. ✅ **Reliable Delivery**: Emails send successfully to all users
6. ✅ **Proper Scheduling**: Daily scheduler works with user isolation

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Once testing is complete:

1. **Set Environment Variables** in Railway:
   ```
   SENDER_EMAIL=your-production-email@gmail.com
   SENDER_PASSWORD=your-production-app-password
   SENDER_NAME=SomonGPT Real Estate Intelligence
   ```

2. **Schedule Daily Tasks** using Railway Cron Jobs or external scheduler

3. **Monitor Email Delivery** through logs and user feedback

4. **Update Frontend URLs** in notification service for production
